## 🧪 Synthetic Data Generator Overview

The synthetic dataset generator is designed to support **controlled feature-selection and robustness experiments**, particularly in the context of **medical AI classification**.

### Supported feature types

The generator creates a mixture of:

- **Informative continuous predictors**  
  Features with controlled marginal association to the target.

- **Categorical predictors**  
  Generated via quantile binning of the target with added noise.

- **Time-dependent predictors**  
  Features with trend + seasonality components.

- **Redundant / noise predictors**  
  Oracle-irrelevant features independent of the target.

- **Optional low-variance features**  
  Used to test robustness to degenerate predictors.

### Target types

- **Binary classification** (default, used in the paper)
- **Continuous regression**

All randomness is controlled via a fixed `random_state` for full reproducibility.

## 🔗 Correlation Control (Important Note)

The parameter `correlation_strength` specifies the **intended marginal dependence** between informative features and the target.

Due to finite-sample effects and the iterative adjustment used in the **binary classification case**, the *achieved* empirical correlation may be slightly lower than the requested value.

> **Practical guideline:**  
> To obtain an empirical point-biserial correlation of approximately **0.3**, set:
> ```python
> correlation_strength = 0.4
> ```
> and verify the realised correlations using the provided utilities.

This behaviour is explicitly accounted for in the supplementary analysis.

## ▶️ How to Run the Code

### 1. Requirements

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn scipy
```

Run the script directly:

```bash
python synthetic_data_generator.py
```

This will generate:
**synthetic_feature_selection_dataset.csv**
containing:

Continuous predictors X1 ... Xn

Optional transformed features

Binary target variable Y

## 🔍 Correlation Diagnostics – Important Interpretation Note##

The optional correlation diagnostics generated by this repository (via
plot_and_export_correlations) compute linear Pearson correlations between each feature and the target.

⚠️ These diagnostics are provided strictly as indicative summaries and must not be interpreted as definitive measures of statistical dependence.

Specifically:

The reported correlations are not:

- Mutual information estimates

- Spearman rank correlations

- Non-linear dependence measures

Pearson correlation captures only linear associations and may:

- Underestimate dependence for non-linear feature–target relationships

- Fail to reflect higher-order or interaction effects

- Be misleading when feature distributions are non-Gaussian or discretised

***Intended role in this repository**

The correlation outputs are included solely to verify that:

- Oracle-informative features exhibit a non-zero marginal association with the target

- Oracle-irrelevant features are approximately independent (up to finite-sample noise)

- The synthetic generator behaves as expected under the chosen parameters

They should not be used as evidence of true relevance or sufficiency.

**Recommended practice**

For rigorous dependence analysis and feature relevance assessment, proper non-linear techniques should be employed, including but not limited to:

- Mutual Information estimators

- Kernel-based dependence measures

- Model-based attribution methods (e.g., SHAP, permutation importance)

- Task-specific performance metrics (ROC, confusion matrices)

Indeed, all substantive conclusions in the accompanying paper are based on:

- Mutual Information filtering

- SHAP explanations

- Predictive performance comparisons

as documented in the supplementary PDF

## 📊 Supplementary PDF Contents

The file **Synthetic_data_analysis.pdf** contains the full synthetic experiment suite used in the paper.

Experimental design

Total features: 20 continuous predictors

Sample size: 10,000 (plus 10% and 1% subsamples)

Oracle-informative features:

k=2

k=10

k=18

Binary outcome: approximately balanced classes

Target correlation: empirical point-biserial ≈ 0.3

Figures included (for each k and sample size)

Mutual Information (MI) estimates

SHAP summary plots for Class 0 and Class 1, all features vs oracle-informative only

Confusion matrices

ROC curves

Each configuration compares:

Training with all features

Training with oracle-informative features only

**Key conclusion supported by the figures**

Feature pruning yields the largest performance gains under data scarcity, with:

Clearer ROC separation

More stable confusion matrices

Concentrated SHAP attributions

As sample size increases, performance differences diminish, indicating that sufficient data allows models to attenuate irrelevant inputs through learning and regularisation.
